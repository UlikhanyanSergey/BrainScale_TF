# BrainScale_TF

This Terraform configuration sets up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) on AWS with an associated target group and an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to host instances of a Dockerized web application. The infrastructure includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public subnets and security groups allowing inbound traffic on ports 22, 80, and 3000.
